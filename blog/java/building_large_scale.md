# How to build Building large-scale projects

Building large-scale projects requires careful consideration of various architectural characteristics. Here are the top 10 aspects to focus on:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability: Ensure the system can handle increased users or requests by scaling horizontally or vertically.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Traffic Pattern: Understand the system's traffic patterns to optimize resource allocation and cost-efficiency.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Elasticity: Enable the system to quickly scale up or down to handle traffic bursts.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Latency: Optimize response time by replicating the system near users and optimizing algorithms.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Availability: Aim for high uptime and functionality by addressing errors, infrastructure problems, and attacks.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Extensibility: Design the system to allow for easy extension of functionality without impacting existing features.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Consistency: Ensure data consistency across all nodes, improving data freshness.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Resiliency: Build the system to handle and recover from failures efficiently, maintaining service continuity.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Usability: Prioritize user experience, considering accessibility, learnability, and API contracts.

üîü Observability: Enhance system observability through logging, monitoring, and support processes.

üîí Security: Implement measures to protect information, ensure authentication, authorizations, compliance, and privacy.

üîã Durability: Ensure the system's serviceability and ability to meet long-term needs through replication, fault tolerance, and archiving.

‚öôÔ∏è Agility: Focus on maintainability, testability, ease of development, deployability, and configurability to adapt to changes.

By understanding and incorporating these characteristics, you can design robust and efficient systems.
